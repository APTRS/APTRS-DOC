APTRS can be installed using two methods:

- Docker (Recommended for most users)
- Manual (User with Knowledge of Ngnix and Little Python and Nodejs)


!!! note

    APTRS does not natively support Windows installations and setting it up on Windows is not recommended. While it's possible to manually install certain components (such as the APTRS Backend, Frontend, and Database) on Windows, key dependencies like Redis require a Linux environment. Instead, you can use the Docker setup for Windows, which is the preferred option for Windows users.
