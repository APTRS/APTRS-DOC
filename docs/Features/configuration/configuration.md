# Configuration

The Configuration section allows admin users or users with the Manage Configurations permission to add and manage various settings. In APTRS, users can define Project Types, such as "Mobile Application Testing," which are used when creating projects and are also referenced in PDF and DOCX reports. Multiple project types can be added to suit different testing needs.

In addition to project types, users can also create Report Standards. When generating a report, users are required to select the applicable testing standard, such as OWASP for web application testing. Users can add additional standards here, which can then be used in the generated reports.
