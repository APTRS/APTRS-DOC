# Vulnerability DB (or Template)


The Vulnerability DB or Template feature in APTRS allows you to add and manage a database of vulnerabilities that can be reused across different projects. When adding a vulnerability to a project, you can specify all necessary details such as the title, description, solution, CVSS score, and more.

If you encounter the same vulnerability in multiple projects, such as IDOR or SQL Injection, the Vulnerability DB allows you to save time by reusing the same information without needing to write it again for each project. This helps streamline reporting and ensures consistency across projects.

By creating templates for common vulnerabilities, you can easily import them when adding vulnerabilities to new projects, reducing redundant work and improving efficiency.
