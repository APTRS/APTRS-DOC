# Customer Management in APTRS


Customers in APTRS are external users who belong to external (non-internal) companies. You can manage these users from the Customer page, where external users are added and tracked, and they are included in reports as customer users.

### Adding Customers
When adding a customer, you will need to provide the following information:

- Email: The customer's email address.
- Company: The external company they belong to.
- Password: A password is required as part of the future functionality.


Though passwords are required during customer creation, as of version 1.0, external users do not yet have access to login, API, or dashboard features. These features are planned for future releases, where customers will be able to log into the APTRS dashboard, view ongoing and past projects, download reports, and more.

This allows APTRS to lay the groundwork for future functionality while managing customer data and ensuring they are accurately represented in reports.
